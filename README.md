## Project Overview

This repository contains code, dataset, and results for an AI-powered AQI prediction system developed as part of an academic project. The system experiments with multiple machine learning and deep learning architectures to forecast AQI from pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO₂, NOx, CO, SO₂, O₃, NH₃, Benzene, Toluene, Xylene, etc.).

## Highlights / Key Results

- Classical ML: Random Forest Regressor achieved high baseline performance (R² ≈ **0.8775**).
- Deep learning:  
  - BiLSTM (without Attention) achieved **R² ≈ 0.9461**.  
  - CNN + LSTM (with Attention) achieved **R² ≈ 0.9465**.
